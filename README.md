hello world by github intro
Holla, my name is Dan ( slavic name but shortened ) and new to github... going trough tutorial to set it up. Sooo.... 
I like to work on a lot of stuff, but mostly i use programming to help me speed up my actual work, as i am architectural student
Code i write is mostly based on architecture speed ( acad dynamic blocks, sketchup elements, Rhino plugins and etc ) but i also do 
code stuff that is fun for me personally.
